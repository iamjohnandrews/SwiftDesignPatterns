Adapter Script 

Context:
Say you’ve got an existing software system that you need to work a new vendor class library into, but the new vendor designed their interfaces differently than the last vendor.

Problem:
Okay, you don’t want to solve the problem by changing your existing code (and you can’t change the vendor’s code). So what do you do? Well, you can write a class that adapts the new vendor interface into the one you’re expecting.


Final Solution:
The adapter acts as the middleman by receiving requests from the client and converting them into requests that make sense on the vendor classes.

How it works:
① The client makes a request to the adapter by calling a method on it using the target interface.
② The adapter translates the request into one or more calls on the adaptee using the adaptee interface.
③ The client receives the results of the call and never knows there is an adapter doing the translation.

Why Adapter Pattern works:
the great thing about us adapters is that we allow clients to make use of new libraries and subsets without changing any code; they just rely on us to do the conversion for them. Hey, it’s a niche, but we’re good at it.
